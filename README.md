## CLAVIER: (ColLaborAtiVe edItor for Extreme pRogramming)
An Editor/IDE that facilitates pair programming and Extreme Programming.

A key practice in XP is pair programming: two programmers (driver and navigator) developing software working side by side.

The driver writes the code and the navigator writes notes and thinks strategically trying to stay one step ahead of the driver.

When programmers are at different sites and/or sit at different computers, it becomes difficult to apply PP.

CLAVIER makes remote pair programming XP-style easy and effective.
In particular, in CLAVIER the code is visible to both driver and navigator. Only the driver is allowed to type in the code window, but it is possible for the navigator to point at code.

Also, CLAVIER allows the the navigator to write notes on ideas and things to do, while the driver edits the code.

To avoid distracting the driver, the navigatorâ€™s notes can be freezed.

Finally, CLAVIER makes it possible to swap the roles of driver and navigator at the click of a button.
